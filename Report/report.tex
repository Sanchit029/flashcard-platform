\begin{abstract}
	
StudyGenie is an innovative web-based platform that revolutionizes the way students create and interact with study materials. Traditional methods of manually creating flashcards and quiz questions from educational content are time-consuming and often fail to capture the most important concepts effectively. This project addresses these challenges by developing an intelligent system that leverages artificial intelligence and natural language processing to automatically generate high-quality study materials from uploaded PDF documents.

The system is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrates advanced AI algorithms to extract key concepts from textual content and transform them into interactive learning materials. StudyGenie offers two primary functionalities: automated flashcard generation and multiple-choice question (MCQ) creation. The platform features an intuitive user interface with 3D animated flashcards, timed quizzes, and comprehensive progress tracking.

Key technical achievements include the implementation of a robust document processing pipeline capable of handling PDF files up to 10MB, a secure JWT-based authentication system, and responsive design ensuring compatibility across desktop and mobile devices. The system demonstrates excellent performance metrics with average API response times under 2.1 seconds for AI processing and support for 50+ concurrent users.

Comprehensive testing validates that StudyGenie achieves a 95.6\% overall success rate across all functional requirements. The platform successfully bridges the gap between traditional study methods and modern AI-powered educational technology, providing students with an efficient, engaging, and personalized learning experience. Future enhancements include support for additional file formats, collaborative study features, and advanced analytics for learning progress optimization.
